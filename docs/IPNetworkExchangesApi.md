# **AddIPNetworkExchange**
> IpNetworkExchangeResponse AddIPNetworkExchange($body, $cookie)

Create an IP Network Exchange

Create an IP network exchange to enable access between IP networks that have non-overlapping addresses, so that instances on these networks can exchange packets with each other without NAT.<p>After creating an IP network exchange, you can add IP networks to the same IP network exchange to enable access between instances on these IP networks. Use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"op-network-v1-ipnetwork-{name}-put.html\">PUT /network/v1/ipnetwork/{name}</a> request to add an IP network to an IP network exchange. An IP network exchange can include multiple IP networks, but an IP network can be added to only one IP network exchange.<p><b>Required Role: </b> To complete this task, you must have the <code>Compute_Operations</code> role. If this role isn't assigned to you or you're not sure, then ask your system administrator to ensure that the role is assigned to you in Oracle Cloud My Services.
